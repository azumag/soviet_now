"""strategy.py - Soviet Puzzle Game AI Drop Position Script

Game Overview:
  - Drop pieces, merge same type pieces (N+N -> N+1)
- Score table: type1=1, type2=3, type3=6, ..., typeN = N*(N+1)/2
- Board: x in [-3.0, +3.0], floor y=-4.48, deadline y=3.32
  - Player controls only drop X coordinate

      Decision Logic (11 evaluation axes):
         1. Merge bonus - High score for immediate merge (DIRECT > NEAR > FAR)
         1.5. NEAR merge deadline risk - Penalty for risky NEAR merges at deadline (v366/v385: per-candidate crosses_deadline)
        2. Height penalty - Penalty for high landing position (varies by phase)
         3. Drift penalty - Penalty for post-landing drift due to polygon shape
         4. Left-right balance correction - Bonus for correcting piece count bias
          5. nextNext centering - Center for next merge opportunity if nextNext same type
           5.5. Avoid blocking nextNext merge - Penalty for landing on same-type piece when nextNext matches
           5.6. Growth center proximity - Compact board around highest-type piece (v370: all-reactive, congestion-aware)
            6. Chain merge bonus - Evaluate possibility of further merges after merge
            7. Reactive pairs bonus - Bonus for multiple merge opportunities (reactor info utilization, v206: enhanced)
            8. Early game merge priority - Strong bonus for merge opportunities in early game
             8.5. Danger zone immediate merge bonus - v331: deadline_crossed時即時併合強化
             8.6. Reactive pairs immediate merge bonus - v321: 即時併合ボーナス維持

              #   - ロシアが盤面にある状態で type 13, 14 級のピースをどこに育てるかの空間計画が必要

     # v398: merge drought scatter prevention — coordinate stacking/congestion/edge for reactive>=3 no-merge
     # When merge_available=false AND reactive_pair_count>=3 (merge drought), pieces scatter to floor
     # edges (x=±3) because congestion penalty inversion (low-y bonus ~100-200) overwhelms guidance
     # (~150-400). Edge placement isolates pieces from reactive pair "merge zone", preventing catalytic
     # chain merges → piece_count spiral → game over. Worst T44-55: reactive=5-6, 4 consecutive scatter
     # to x=±3 → pc 33→39 → death. Best T125-132: reactive=1, concentrated board → +269 chain.
     # Four coordinated changes using _merge_drought flag:
     #   1. Extend axis 9.6 stacking to ALL types during drought (line ~920 condition: add _merge_drought)
     #   2. Suppress axis 9.6b proximity during drought (line ~1078: add _merge_drought to exclusion)
     #   3. Suppress congestion penalty during drought (line ~1262: add `and not _merge_drought`)
     #   4. Add edge scatter penalty: |x|>2.0 → -80*(|x|-2.0), up to -80 at board edge
     # Net effect: center placement gains ~88-204 pt advantage during drought, robustly preventing
     # HEIGHT_CONTROL scatter death spiral. Stacking bonus (~200-400 * reactive_density_mult)
     # provides center-biased guidance; edge penalty prevents floor-edge escape.
     # v397 height_mult cap (0.5) and axis 8.8 (-3000) still enforce overall discipline.
     # NOT reactive<3 guard (primary use case). NOT danger bonus. NOT stacking suppression.
